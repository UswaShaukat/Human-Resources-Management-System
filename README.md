I developed an HRMS for a university, featuring four key modules: Employee Management (including Document and Job History Management), Department Management, Designation Management, and Leave & Attendance Tracking. The system generates daily, weekly, and monthly reports for leave balance, attendance, and approvals.
For real-time attendance tracking, the system integrates with Hikvision attendance devices, which send data to iVMS software before syncing with the database. This third-party integration ensures accurate attendance monitoring.![screencapture-localhost-3000-AdminDashboard-2025-01-13-17_44_57](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f27c025-e3bd-4244-a852-45e3203eba4f)
